# String-Formatting
Hello there , here I learnt that in string manipulation ,
we have to consider utilizing modulo operator and format () 

In modulo operator we have place holder in string "" , where we put 
our statement ,and then put the %s to substitute the things we want to substitute 
after the "" say we put print("I'm %s"%("fahmi")),then, the result will print I'm fahmi

That is it 
then we have .format(), it is function to substitute the {} with .format(something)
For example, print("Hi {},may I ask you something?".format("Mr. Fahmi"))
